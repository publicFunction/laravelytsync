# Laravel You Tube Sync
Laravel You Tube Sync. Sync your You Tube Channel when new content is created. Playlists and videos, ready for you to put on your site. We use the power of the You Tube API to sync your channels content 

A standalone version of the classes will be made available once I am happy this all works. Currently I am only using the Server API Key Auth system for ease of development, but later versions will have full support for OAuth2 as well as Server/Browser API key implimentaion and pulling content live to your site from YT, removing the need for database tables and storage.

Initial version will only cater for pulling data from the YT API via server or browser API key access.
